## Black Hole

**Black Hole** is a lightweight, secure, and offline-first password manager built with simplicity and privacy in mind.  
Your passwords are stored locally, encrypted, and protected by a single master password — **nothing ever leaves your system**.

### Features

- 🔐 **Local-Only Encryption** — All passwords are encrypted with your master password and stored on your device.  
- 🧠 **Master Password System** — Set and manage one key to access your vault.  
- 💾 **Secure Database** — Uses a local database for encrypted storage.

2. Run the installer to install the program
3. On initial setup you can choose to either *setup a new vault*, or *import an existing one*
4. If you want to setup a new vault, you will be prompted to set a save location. This will be where the database containing your passwords will be stored
5. You will then be prompted for a master password, which you will use to unlock your vault, you will also be given a sync key, which you will use if you wanted to setup an existing vault
6. Once you seup your vault, you can click the *add new* to add a new account card
7. Once the card is created, click the *edit* button to add details, notes and a image, or pin to tray
